1. What classes does each implementation include? Are the lists the same?



2. Write down a sentence to describe each class.


3. How do the classes relate to each other? It might be helpful to draw a diagram on a whiteboard or piece of paper.

4. What data does each class store? How (if at all) does this differ between the two implementations?
5. What methods does each class have? How (if at all) does this differ between the two implementations?

6. Consider the Order#total_price method. In each implementation:
  Is logic to compute the price delegated to "lower level" classes like ShoppingCart and CartEntry, or is it retained in Order?
  Does total_price directly manipulate the instance variables of other classes?

7. If we decide items are cheaper if bought in bulk, how would this change the code? Which implementation is easier to modify?

8. Which implementation better adheres to the single responsibility principle?

9. Bonus question once you've read Metz ch. 3: Which implementation is more loosely coupled?

1. What is this class's responsibility?
  You should be able to describe it in a single sentence.
2. Is this class responsible for exactly one thing?
3. Does this class take on any responsibility that should be delegated to "lower level" classes?
4. Is there code in other classes that directly manipulates this class's instance variables?
